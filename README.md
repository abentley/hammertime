Hammer Time
===========
This is a tool that tests Juju's behaviour under non-ideal conditions, such as
machines rebooting, processes dying, etc.

It uses chaos-generating code from
[Matrix](https://github.com/juju-solutions/matrix), but whereas Matrix is
designed to test charms, Hammer Time tests Juju itself.
